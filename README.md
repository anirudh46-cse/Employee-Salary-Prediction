# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction

An interactive Streamlit application that predicts employee salaries based on input features like experience using a Linear Regression model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project helps users—HR teams, job seekers, and analysts—predict employee salaries based on historical data. It's built using Python, trained with scikit-learn, and deployed through a Streamlit dashboard for ease of access and usage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Streamlit  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- joblib  
- matplotlib

## 💡 Model Description

A simple Linear Regression model was used:
- Easy to interpret  
- Suitable for continuous output  
- Evaluated using R² and MAE

Model trained via:
```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Streamlit Dashboard
Features:
- Slider/input for experience
- Displays real-time salary prediction
- Clean, minimal UI with optional styling and validation
Run locally:
streamlit run app.py
